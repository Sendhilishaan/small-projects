## Boids simulation in pygame

Simple boids simulation, displays rectangles as boids

### Parameters

- number of boids can be changed by changing the flock input parameter
- cohesion, seperation, and alignment can be changed by changing the fields in the boid class

### TODO:
- add sliders for changing the cohesion, serperation, and alignment attributes
- make it look prettier
- fix bug where a group of boids can get stuck / small circle rotations

- implement feature that changes color of all boids grouped together
- add boids on click at location

also can probably use numpy for faster vector operations, but not a bottleneck whatsoever

idea... evil boids...
