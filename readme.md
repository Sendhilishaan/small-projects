## collection of small projects

Small projects that I work on inbetween big projects or if I see something cool I want to implement. Mostly fun graphics / algorithms / math.

### boids:

A bird flocking simulation based on the boids artificial life program by Craig Reynolds.

This is implemented in python using pygame and numpy.

### conway's game of life:

self explanatory. Implemented in C using sdl2.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes:

Fun, fast prime number generator with lots of room for code optimisation.
